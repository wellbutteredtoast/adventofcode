# Advent of Code 2025

The Advent of Code is pretty cool, I've never done one before. So this is my first one! Most of these are gonna be done in Python, I tried Java but that became a complete mess and I decided I'll stick to langauges I actually know and am comfortable with.

Python is pretty good, and pretty productive, not *every problem* will be in it but most of them will be.
