# Advent of Code

All of my own Advent of Code solutions, including their problem text and input data. MIT licensed, anybody can use these as long as they follow that license properly.

Though the first advent of code I participated in is 2025, during the off time (AKA, over winter and spring) I'll work away at past problems until I've completed them all!

I'm mostly a Python user, though I may dip into C++ and other languages I'm competent with on an "as-needed" basis, or just to flex those muscles and keep myself sharp.
